# Smart-Contract-for-Leave-Application-Managment-
In today’s time, we use the Leave Application System managed by some central authority. This can lead to corruption, misuse by a single authority or unnecessary time for approval
So,
we have developed a smart contract for
Leave application using Solidity and Ethereum
also in today's time leave management application work as a
centralized client-server system. it takes a lot of time for approval and also server data may get damaged or misused for someone’s
profit. So, we need some new technology such as smart
contract decentralized application which solves all of the
above limitations.

When we consider the contracts in the real world, we
always need someone as an intermediary who verifies that
the contract is signed by the two or multiple parties involved
and this intermediary also has the job of enforcing involved
parties to fulfill the contracts condition but a smart contract
is smart as it is a self-executing contract which doesn’t
need an intermediary. This is made possible with the use of
cryptographic techniques which allow digital signing along
with Blockchain which can be thought of as an immutable
distributed ledger.
